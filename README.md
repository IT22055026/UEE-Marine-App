## 🧪 UX Process

Our design was guided by the **Design Thinking Process**:

1. **Empathize** – Created 4 user personas & empathy maps  
2. **Define** – Collected functional & non-functional requirements  
3. **Ideate** – Conducted interviews, surveys, competitor analysis  
4. **Prototype** – Developed wireframes and interactive prototypes  
5. **Test** – Collected feedback via video recordings and questionnaires

---

## 📊 Research Highlights

- Collected qualitative feedback through interviews and questionnaires.
- Key suggestions included modern UI enhancements, clearer blog cards, optimized event map layout, and better navigation design.
- Integrated real-world marine conservation trends through comparative studies (e.g., Dive+, Marine Debris Tracker).
